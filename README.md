### Empowering Communities to Share and Trade Renewable Energy

---

## Project Overview
**crossGrid** is a blockchain-based platform designed to empower communities to share and trade renewable energy efficiently and transparently. By leveraging decentralized technology, crossGrid addresses key challenges such as:
- Energy distribution inefficiencies.
- Overproduction and wastage of renewable energy.
- Limited access to clean energy in underserved areas.

The platform enables energy producers, such as households with solar panels, to share surplus energy with others in their community. Smart contracts facilitate secure and automated transactions, ensuring fair pricing and reliable energy distribution without intermediaries.

---

## Key Features
### 1. **Community-Driven Energy Sharing**
- Producers can share surplus energy with their neighbors seamlessly.
- Promotes efficient use of renewable resources like solar energy.

### 2. **Smart Contract Automation**
- Ensures trustless and transparent transactions.
- Fair pricing is enforced automatically without centralized intermediaries.

### 3. **Built on CrossFI Blockchain**
- Leverages the scalability and low transaction fees of the **CrossFI blockchain**.
- Provides fast, efficient, and secure energy-sharing transactions.

### 4. **Access to Clean Energy**
- Designed to increase energy access for underserved and remote areas.
- Promotes sustainability by maximizing renewable energy usage.

## How It Works
1. **Energy Production**: Households and small producers generate renewable energy (e.g., solar panels).
2. **Energy Sharing**: Surplus energy is uploaded to the network.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Transactions are executed automatically between producers and consumers.
4. **Energy Access**: Community members purchase energy transparently with fair pricing.
5. **Settlement**: Payments are made seamlessly on the CrossFI blockchain.
